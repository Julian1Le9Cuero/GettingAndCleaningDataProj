# Getting And Cleaning Data - Course Project

This repository contains the documentation and the code that completes the project from Getting And Cleaning Data Course available in Coursera. The purpose of the project, as mentioned in the description of this repository, is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The name of the data set is Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset. Which roughly has the data about the experiments that were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

# Files/Scripts

Besides this one, there are other two relevant files. First, you will find CodeBook.md, which essentially explains the steps performed to clean the data set and it also explains the variables in run_analysis.R. Secondly, as I have just said, we have run_analysis.R, which contains the code that collects and cleans the raw data set. In that file, we assumed that the data is in the same folder.
